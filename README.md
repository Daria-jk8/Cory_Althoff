# DATA STRUCTURE
1. Stack
2. Queue

## S - T - A- C - K
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
Stack operations may involve initializing the stack, using it and then de-initializing it. Apart from these basic stuffs, a stack is used for the following two primary operations −

Basic Operations: 
 - push() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.
 - pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.
 - peek() − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.
 - isFull() − check if stack is full.
 - isEmpty() − check if stack is empty. Returns True if the stack is empty, else False.
 - size() - returns an integer representing the number of elements on the stack

## Q - U - E - U - E
Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

Operations associated with queue are: 
 - enqueue() -  Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition
 - dequeue() -  Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed.
 - front() -  Get the front item from queue 
 - rear() -  Get the last item from queue 
 - isEmpty() − check if stack is empty. Returns True if the stack is empty, else False.
 - size() - returns an integer representing the number of elements on the stack

# ALGORITHMS

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.

 - FizzBuzz
 - Sequential Search
 - Palindrome
 - Anagram
 - Count occurrences of characters
 - Recursion 


\\ FizzBuzz - “Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.”
\\ Sequential Search: In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list that checks each element in sequence until the desired element is found or the list is exhausted. The list need not be ordered.
\\ Palindrome - A string is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as string. For example, “radar” is a palindrome, but “radix” is not a palindrome.
\\ Anagram - of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different.
\\ Count occurrences of characters - can count the occurrence of a value in strings using the count() function. It will return how many times the value appears in the given string.
\\ Recursion  -The term Recursion can be defined as the process of defining something in terms of itself. In simple words, it is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
